        JSplitPolygon is a JAVA library designed to split a polygon into two polygons when the polygon
        crosses the antimeridian.

        <br/>
        In the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946">GeoJson requirement</a>, the polygon must be
        cut when it crosses the antimeridian:
        <i>In representing Features that cross the antimeridian, interoperability is improved by modifying 
            their geometry.  Any geometry that crosses the antimeridian SHOULD be represented by cutting it 
            in two such that neither part's representation crosses the antimeridian.</i>
        <br/>
        A rectangle extending from 40 degrees N, 170 degrees E across the antimeridian to 50 degrees N, 
        170 degrees W should be cut in two and represented as a MultiPolygon.
